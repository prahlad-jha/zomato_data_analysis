# 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes the **Zomato dataset** using Python to uncover key insights about customer preferences, restaurant ratings, online vs offline orders, and spending patterns.  

The analysis answers important business questions such as:  
1. What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?  
2. How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?  
3. What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?  
4. What is the average spending of couples who order food online?  
5. Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?  
6. Which type of restaurant receives more offline orders, so Zomato can provide those customers with offers?
